   <p>Did you know petra was once hidden? It is also one of the 7 wonders of the world. In 2019 alone, there were over 1 million tourists who came to see Petra.</p>
   <p>The men in Petra wear something called "Kohl". Kohl looks like eyeliner, however, it is mentioned in the Quran, and is reccomended for men and women to wear for good deeds. It helps fight the sun rays, and clears vision.</p>
