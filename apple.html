<p>I love wadi rum for its beauty and the memories it gives me.</p>
<p>Wadi Rum (Arabic: وادي رم Wādī Ramm, also Wādī al-Ramm), known also as the Valley of the Moon (Arabic: وادي القمر Wādī al-Qamar), is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan 60 km (37 mi) to the east of Aqaba; it is the largest wadi in Jordan.</p>
<p> In the second term of Grade 8, my whole grade took an overnight trip to Wadi Rum. I was able to share a cabin with two of my best friends, and our next door cabins were people we were good friends with. Because we didn't have our phones, we were all able to socialize and talk with eachother. I am very thankful our phones were taken. To take pictures and capture memories, I took my moms camera from the 2000s. Here are some pictures.</p>
